# Butterfly

## WHY

This exercise tones and conditions abductor muscles and enables you to pull your legs back more comfortably in the second stage of labor. It also helps reduce shaking of legs after the birth and unnecessary pain.

## HOW

The pregnant woman sits on the floor, leaning back against a wall or furniture with knees up (bent) and feet side by side flat on the floor. Coach, place flats of hands on the outside of her knees and apply resistance while the mother tries to open her legs. Remember, this is not a contest; only apply resistance when legs are going down, not on the way up. Legs need only go down as far as comfortable.

## WHEN

This is a powerful exercise, so 3-10 times once a day is plenty.

## HOW THE COACH CAN HELP

Your active help is needed for this one. Apply resistance only; this is not a contest. As she gets stronger, apply a little more pressure. Do not overdo this exercise: it is a powerful one.
