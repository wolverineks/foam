## <span style="color:red">**DO NOT CONSENT TO EPISIOTOMY**</span>

## What

a surgical cut made at the opening of the vagina during childbirth, to aid a difficult delivery and prevent rupture of tissues.

## Types

### Medio-lateral

- The incision is made downward and outward from the midpoint of the fourchette either to the right or left. It is directed diagonally in a straight line which runs about 2.5 cm (1 in) away from the anus (midpoint between the anus and the ischial tuberosity).

### Median

- The incision commences from the centre of the fourchette and extends on the posterior side along the midline for 2.5 cm (1 in).

### Lateral

- The incision starts from about 1 cm (0.4 in) away from the centre of the fourchette and extends laterally. Drawbacks include the chance of injury to the Bartholin's duct, therefore some practitioners have strongly discouraged lateral incisions.

### J-shaped

- The incision begins in the centre of the fourchette and is directed posteriorly along the midline for about 1.5 centimetres (0.59 in) and then directed downwards and outwards along the 5 or 7 o'clock position to avoid the internal and external anal sphincter. This procedure is also not widely practised.

## Williams Obstetrics

- does not protect against incontinence
- increases risk of fecal incontinence
- does not preserve pelvic floor muscles
- is worse than a spontaneous tear
- increases risk of tearing through rectum
- increases risk of second-degree tear
