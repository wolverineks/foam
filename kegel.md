# Kegel

## WHY

This exercise helps maintain proper tone in the pelvic floor or pubococcygeus muscle. Poor tone may cause: incontinence - wetting pants when coughing or sneezing; discomfort; lack of sensation during intercourse; unusual pain during birth; premature flexion of babyâ€™s head; prolonged second stage; damage to muscle; and feelings of pressure. (Three months of daily practice often shows substantial improvement, as shown in your BradleyTM 12 week class series each week.)

## HOW

Tighten your Kegel muscle. It feels as if you are pulling everything in your pelvic area up. Then, relax. Progress each week.

## WHEN

Do this exercise many times a day, increasing each day.

## HOW THE COACH CAN HELP

The hardest part of this exercise is remembering to do it. Please remind her often. It is also a good exercise for coaches (men have this muscle, too).
