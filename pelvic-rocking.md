# Pelvic Rocking

## WHY

This exercise probably produces more benefits than any other pregnancy exercise. It tones and conditions the muscles of the lower back and abdominal muscles; it relieves pressure (on lower back, major blood vessels, ureters, and bladder); it increases circulation, relieves general tension, and often improves digestion. When done properly, this exercise helps the baby come forward, relieving pressure.

## HOW

In hands and knees position (hands and knees should form a box), relax lower back, allowing pelvis to tilt forward (comfortably), then level and tuck hips under (do slowly and rhythmically with control). This exercise moves the lower part of the body only.

## WHEN

Do for brief and frequent periods throughout the day, before relaxation practices, and at bed time.

## HOW THE COACH CAN HELP

Place your hand (using light pressure) on her lower back to give her an area she can concentrate on, or hands on either side of pelvis. light pressure with thumbs as she rotates pelvis down. Gentle pull with fingers as she brings back up flat position. Remind her to do this exercise before going to bed, even if she is tired; she and the baby may sleep more comfortably.
