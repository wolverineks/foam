# Progressive Relaxation Technique

1. Both: Start by reviewing the tense/relax technique.
2. Mom: Imagine you are in the shower or under a gentle waterfall on a warm day in Hawaii. Feel the water as it flows over your head and down the back of your head and face. Smell the freshness and let your body absorb the moisture as you relax your head, neck, and shoulders. Notice how the water cascades over your shoulders in smooth sheets and caresses your arms, elbows, wrists and each finger as it drains off your hands. Just let go of these muscles as they begin to feel the relaxing sensation of this warm water.
3. Mom: Feel the water run down your back and hips and down your neck, breasts, and abdomen. Feel these muscles releasing and letting go. Think about how relaxing this must be to your baby. Warm, safe, and comfortable. Now focus on the water flowing down your legs, to knees, to ankles, to feet, and toes as it washes away the tension and pressure of the day.
4. Coach: Be sure that the pace of your speech and the tone of your voice lowers as you assist her to become more and more relaxed.
