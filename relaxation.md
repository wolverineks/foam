# Relaxation

## CONCENTRATE AS YOU PRACTICE

Be sure to take this time very seriously. Mother,
keep your mind active and concentrate on relaxing. Keep your eyes closed. Pretend that you are in labor, if you can. Coach, pay attention. Is she as relaxed as she can be? You must convey relaxation through your touch, through your voice, and through your actions. It may not be easy for her to concentrate and relax for very long; praise her for her effor ts and recognize her progress. Remember, the better you can work together to achieve deep relaxation in practice, the better it will work in labor.

## PRACTICE IN VARIOUS SITUATIONS

During your labor you will need to be relaxed, because you will be working very hard. Your mind will be quite active and you will be concentrating. You may be walking, sitting, watching TV, cleaning the house, pelvic rocking, taking a shower or bath, or lying down. So, practice relaxing at various times and in various places.
