# Side Relaxation

## WHY

This is a safe and comfortable position for sleeping and in labor. This position helps circulation and allows the bed to support the baby’s weight. It is also important during labor, to reduce stress or strain on body parts and enable the uterus to work unencumbered.

## HOW

Start on your side with both knees slightly bent and the top leg forward. Your pillow should be at an angle under your head and breast. Your bottom arm may be behind you; if that’s uncomfor table, bring it around over the top of your head.

## WHEN

Practice twice a day, once alone and once with your coach. This position may also be used for sleep. Practice each week in class with new techniques.

## HOW THE COACH CAN HELP

Remind her to do this exercise and practice with her once a day. Learn how she likes her back rubbed while pregnant. Massage tension away.
