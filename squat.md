# Squat

## WHY

Squatting is a common position used in many cultures. It can be especially beneficial for giving birth. You will probably be trying to imitate this position for the birth, even if you are on a delivery table or birthing bed. Squatting gets the body in the natural alignment to put pressure on the uterus, to prevent arching of the back (which interferes with pushing), to shorten the birth canal, and to increase the outlet of the pelvis by more than 10%. It generally shortens second stage. This exercise also helps to prepare the leg muscles. It is important for the preparation of the perineum.

## HOW

Start by standing straight, with legs comfortably apart. Next, bend knees slightly & tuck hips under (to relieve pressure on the lower back). Then, bend forward (to help keep uterus forward) and squat, keeping heels on the floor. When coming up, do so tail-first halfway, then place hands on legs (to help support lower back) as you come up the rest of the way. Your instructor will show you how to do this exercise with your coach. Some women need to practice for a while before they can get their heels on the floor. If necessary, hang on to something supportive or wear low heels.

## WHEN

As you become more comfortable with this exercise, do it more frequently throughout the day. Avoid bending over; squat instead.

## HOW THE COACH CAN HELP

Remind her to squat every time she goes down to pick up light things. If she has trouble, squat holding on to each other as shown in class.
