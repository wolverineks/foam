# Tailor

## WHY

This is a healthy, natural position, although uncommon in our society. This posture encourages the uterus to move forward, increasing circulation and stretching the inner thighs.

## HOW

Sit on the floor, or sit on the edge of a firm pillow under your bottom, with your legs crossed. Remember good posture. Variation is good, lean forward or backward against something, stretch your legs occasionally. Change position often.

## WHEN

Start with a short period of time. Gradually make tailor sitting a way of life. It can be fun.

## HOW THE COACH CAN HELP

Join in this exercise on the floor. Encourage her to tailor sit whenever possible. Explain to friends and relatives how important this is and have them sit on the floor too. Remind her to move around often.
